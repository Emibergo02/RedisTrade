# RedisTrade

A cross-server trades plugin for Minecraft servers, designed with a focus on consistency, reliability, and seamless player trading across multiple servers.

## Overview

RedisTrade enables players to trade items, currency, or other in-game assets securely across different Minecraft servers using Redis as a backend for fast and reliable data synchronization. The plugin ensures consistent trade states, prevents duplication exploits, and provides a user-friendly interface for players to initiate and complete trades.

## Features

- **Cross-Server Trading**: Players on different servers can trade items or currency in real-time.
- **Redis Integration**: Leverages Redis for fast, reliable, and scalable data management.
- **Consistency & Reliability**: Ensures trade integrity with robust transaction handling to prevent item loss or duplication.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands and GUI (if applicable) for initiating and managing trades.
- **Customizable**: Configurable settings for trade limits, allowed items, and more.
- **Anti-Exploit Mechanisms**: Built-in checks to prevent trade abuse or server crashes.
